# Introduction to `ipcwlsPIC` R package


## Introduction
`ipcwlsPIC` is the R package to fit a new inverse-probability censoring weighted (IPCW) estimating procedure for censored linear regression when the data are partially interval-censored that include doubly-censored (DC) data and partly interval-censored (PIC) and possibly correlated within same cluster.
Let $T$ and $X$ be the event time of interest and its related $p$-vector of covariates, respectively.
Our main objective is to estimate 
the $p$-dimensional quantile coefficient vector ${\boldsymbol{\beta}}_0(\tau)$
for some $\tau \in[\tau_L,\tau_R]\subset (0, 1)$ 
in the following linear regression model:

$$T_i = {\bf x}_i^T {\boldsymbol{\beta}}_0(\tau) + e_i(\tau),\quad i=1, \ldots ,n, $$

where $e_i(\tau)$ is the random error 
whose $\tau$ th quantile conditional on 
${\bf x}_i$ equals 0. 
When the data are subject to partially interval-censoring, 
left and right endpoints of the censoring time, $L$ and $R$,
are observed instead of $T$ such that $T\in(L,R)$.
Note that double-censoring  can also  be viewed as 
a special case of partly interval-censoring, 
i.e., $T$ is left-censored if $L=0$ and right-censored if $R=\infty$. 


## Description
This R package `ipcwlsPIC` implements an inverse-probability censoring weighted (IPCW) procedure for censored quantile regression for (cluster-correlated) partially interval-censored data, which includes both double-censoring and partially interval-censoring.

## Usages 
```{r}
library(PICBayes)
data("mCRC")
d = with(data.frame(mCRC), data.frame(U = ifelse(y==0,R,L),
                                      V = ifelse(y==2,L,R),
                                      # Cluster weighted data
                                      id=(rep(c(table(SITE)),c(table(SITE)))),
                                      # Treatment arm: 0 = FOLFIRI alone, 1 = Panitumumab + FOLFIRI.
                                      x1= case_when(TRT_C == 0 ~ 0, #Pan et al data
                                                    TRT_C == 1 ~ 1),
                                      # Tumor KRAS mutation status: 0 = wild-type, 1 = mutant.
                                      x2= case_when(KRAS_C == 0 ~ 1,
                                                    KRAS_C == 1 ~ 0),
                                      delta = case_when(IC == 0 ~ 1,
                                                        IC == 1 ~ 0)
));
L=(log(d$U));R=log(d$V); delta=d$delta
x = cbind(d$x1,d$x2); id=d$id;  tau=0.1;
